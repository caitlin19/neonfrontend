            <h1> All Parts </h1>
            <h2> Central Processing Unit (CPU) </h2>
            <img src= "no-image.jpg" alt= "Image"> 
            <p> A CPU (Central Processing Unit) is a computer’s brain. It is responsible for all data processing operation and tells the rest of the components what to do. Having a better CPU can improve how fast a computer can run because it can handle more tasks at once.</p>
            <h2> Motherboard </h2>
            <img src= "no-image.jpg" alt= "Image"> 
            <p> The motherboard one of the most important parts of a computer. It is the backbone for each component to communicate and interact with each other. It is often chosen after you have decided on what CPU you want to use.</p>
             <h2> Memory (RAM) </h2>
            <img src= "no-image.jpg" alt= "Image"> 
            <p> The computer’s RAM (Random Access Memory) allows your computer to store memory in the short term. Every program you run will need to use at least a little bit of RAM, and more intensive programs, such as video games, will require larger amounts.</p>
             <h2> Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</h2>
            <img src= "no-image.jpg" alt= "Image"> 
            <p>The graphics processing unit (GPU), also called graphics card or video card, is a specialized electronic circuit that accelerates the creation and rendering of images, video, and animations. It performs fast math calculations while freeing the CPU to perform other tasks.</p>
            <h2> Storage (Solid State or Hard Drive)</h2>
            <img src= "no-image.jpg" alt= "Image"> 
            <p>Every computer needs storage for files and programs. There are 2 major types of storage, HDDs and SSDs. HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) are the cheaper storage option, usually providing more storage for the price compared to SSDs. SSDs (Solid State Drives) allow for faster saving or loading from storage. They are typically more expensive than HDDs.</p>
            <h2> Power Supply Unit</h2>
            <img src= "no-image.jpg" alt= "Image"> 
            <p>A power supply provides power to the entire computer and all of its parts. The type and strength of the power supply you need will change depending on the other parts used. The more powerful parts you build your computer with, the stronger power supply you will need. </p>
             <h2> System Cooling </h2>
            <img src= "no-image.jpg" alt= "Image"> 
            <p>During use, a computer produces heat that may damage the computer itself.A central cooling system is needed for the computer to run safely. There are 2 main types of cooling: air cooling and water cooling. Air cooling uses fans to expel hot air out of the computer, and is often the cheaper and lower maintenance of the two. Water cooling uses water in pipes to remove heat from the computer.</p>
